## Style Guidelines:

- Use a dark green (#006400) as the primary background color to simulate a blackjack table felt.
- Use gold (#FFD700) or yellow (#FFFF00) as an accent color for important text, buttons, and highlights.
- Use white (#FFFFFF) for general text and card values to ensure readability against the dark background.
- Use clear, legible fonts for card values, scores, and game messages.
- Use standard card suit symbols (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades) in a classic style.
- Center the game area with cards and information prominently displayed.
